# Synonymle 🎯

A Wordle-inspired browser game where you guess **synonyms** for a target word in up to 6 tries.

Each guess is scored as:

- 🟩 **Correct** – a direct synonym of the target word  
- 🟨 **Close** – related / near in meaning  
- ⬛ **Wrong** – not close enough in meaning  

Your guesses show as colored tile rows just like Wordle, and your stats (games played, win %, streaks) are saved in `localStorage`.
